# SOC Analyst Home Lab

## Objective

In this project, I created a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) environment to better understand how to detect and respond to cybersecurity threats. I set up Windows servers to act as both target machines for my attack simulations and as hosts for services like ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Mythic C2. By using Kali Linux to simulate attacks and integrating an OS ticketing system for incident management, I was able to gain hands-on experience in network security monitoring, threat detection, and SOC operations.

### Skills Learned

- Practical experience deploying and configuring a SIEM solution (ElasticSearch and Kibana).
- Proficiency in detecting brute-force attacks on SSH and RDP services.
- Experience simulating attacks using Kali Linux, including RDP-based attacks on target machines.
- Ability to analyze logs, create custom dashboards, and set up security alerts.
- Experience with incident management using an OS ticketing system for tracking and responding to security events.
- Hands-on experience with network security monitoring, threat detection, and SOC operations.

### Tools Used

- Vultr for hosting the virtual environment.
- ElasticSearch & Kibana for log ingestion, analysis, and dashboard creation.
- Windows servers for hosting ELK, Mythic C2, and acting as target machines.
- Mythic C2 framework for simulating advanced threats.
- OS Ticketing system integrated with ElasticSearch for managing and tracking security incidents.
- Kali Linux for simulating attacks on target machines using RDP and other methods.

## Key Steps
These are the most important steps and results that I collected throughout this projects.
